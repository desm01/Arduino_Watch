# Arduino_Watch
Code to display the current time on an Arduino 7 Segment Display

Build Instructions:

Go into the code and change the variables Hrs & Min to represent the current time. Then compile and upload to your Arduino. The screen will update every minute to the latest time!

************************************************

This code is useful if you don't have a real time clock to keep track of time and you want to use the internal CPU frequency to measure time.

Be warned this is not as accurate as a RTC and you may lose a few minutes every week.
